# Proposed Conservative Strategy:

## Risk Management Rules:
- Exit positions when model predicts anomaly (80% accurate)
- Hold/enter positions during predicted normal periods
- Maintain higher cash reserves during uncertain periods

## Position Sizing:
- Full position size during strong "normal" signals
- Reduce position size by 50% when confidence below 80%
- Exit completely during high-probability anomaly signals

## If model predicts anomaly (class 1):
   - Reduce equity exposure by 80%
   - Increase cash/bonds position
   - Set strict stop-losses

## If model predicts normal (class 0):
   - Maintain standard equity exposure
   - Normal position sizing
   - Regular stop-loss levels
